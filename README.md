# NMLP
A more neuromorphic MLP substitute (code incoming shortly).

The basic premis: if we use constructive/destructive interference between vectors in different directions as an analogy for constructive/destructive interference between neuron spikes coming from synaptic terminals, you can implement an imperfect analogy to spiking neural networks.  Additionally, shufflenet / butterflynet inspired grouping of neurons is an imperfect analogy to the brain's sparse connectivity.  Between both of these, we can make an GPU-efficient recurrent network which more closely approximates biological neural networks and can be used to study alternative training algorithms and inherent properties of the brain's architecture.
